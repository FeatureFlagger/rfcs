# FeatureFlagger RFCs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put
through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the FeatureFlagger
core team.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a
consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the application.

## When you need to follow this process

You need to follow this process if you intend to make "substantial"
changes to FeatureFlagger or its documentation. What constitutes a
"substantial" change is evolving based on community norms, but may
include the following.

   - A new feature that creates new API surface area, and would
     require a [feature flag] if introduced.
   - The removal of features that already shipped as part of the release
     channel.
   - The introduction of new idiomatic usage or conventions, even if they
     do not include code changes to FeatureFlagger itself.

Some changes do not require an RFC:

   - Rephrasing, reorganizing or refactoring
   - Addition or removal of warnings
   - Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality
criteria (speedup, better browser support)
   - Additions only likely to be _noticed by_ other implementors-of-FeatureFlagger,
invisible to users-of-FeatureFlagger.

If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going
through the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to
submit an RFC first.

## Gathering feedback before submitting

It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept before diving into the
level of API design detail required for an RFC. **You may open an
issue on this repo to start a high-level discussion**, with the goal of
eventually formulating an RFC pull request with the specific implementation
design.

## What the process is

In short, to get a major feature added to FeatureFlagger, one must first get the
RFC merged into the RFC repo as a markdown file. At that point the RFC
is 'active' and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion
into FeatureFlagger.

* Fork the RFC repo https://github.com/FeatureFlagger/rfcs
* Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where
'my-feature' is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).
* Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: **RFCs that do not
present convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the
impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or
alternatives tend to be poorly-received**.
* Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design
feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared
to revise it in response.
* Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support
are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
comments.
* Eventually, the [core team] will decide whether the RFC is a candidate
for inclusion in FeatureFlagger.
* RFCs that are candidates for inclusion in FeatureFlagger will enter a "final comment
period" lasting 7 days. The beginning of this period will be signaled with a
comment and tag on the RFC's pull request. Furthermore,
[FeatureFlagger's official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/featureflagger) will post a
tweet about the RFC to attract the community's attention.
* An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the [core team] and community.
Significant modifications may trigger a new final comment period.
* An RFC may be rejected by the [core team] after public discussion has settled
and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member of
the [core team] should then close the RFC's associated pull request.
* An RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A [core team]
member will merge the RFC's associated pull request, at which point the RFC will
become 'active'.

## The RFC life-cycle

Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the
feature as a pull request to the FeatureFlagger repo. Becoming 'active' is not a rubber
stamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately
be merged; it does mean that the core team has agreed to it in principle
and are amenable to merging it.

Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is
'active' implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its
implementation, nor whether anybody is currently working on it.

Modifications to active RFC's can be done in followup PR's. We strive
to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect the final design of
the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect
every merged RFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at
the time of the next major release; therefore we try to keep each RFC
document somewhat in sync with the language feature as planned,
tracking such changes via followup pull requests to the document.

## Implementing an RFC

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the
RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an
implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an 'active'
RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it,
feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).

## Reviewing RFC's

Each week the [core team] will attempt to review some set of open RFC
pull requests.

We try to make sure that any RFC that we accept is accepted at the
Friday team meeting, and reported in [core team notes]. Every
accepted feature should have a core team champion, who will represent
the feature and its progress.

**FeatureFlagger's RFC process owes its inspiration to the [Ember RFC process]**
